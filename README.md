# _Igrzyska Ścierki 2.0_
The second edition of the Igrzyska Ścierki game. This time, I'm focusing on a code quality too, not only on its workability ;)<br/>
Also, I'm implementing a Spring Security 5 to secure access to the app.<br/>

It's a simple browser game where you can compete with your housemates, who are a bigger clean-freak.<br/>You add yourself and your mates as players, create quests in house chores style (with specific point values). When it's done, you can start playing.<br/>First, you must specify when the concrete game will end. Then, the tournament has been begun.<br/>When someone of you completes any quest, the one is logging in the app and ticking who and what done it.<br/>The winner will be that one who collects the most points, in specified time before.
